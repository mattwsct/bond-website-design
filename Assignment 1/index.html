        <h3>Rebel FM Episode 65 – 06/25/10</h3>
        <p>
          We’re back, and we’ve brought a mean motherfucker in the form of IGN
          News Editor Jim Reilly, who joins the usual cast to discuss
          Transformers, Crackdown 2, Red Dead, and more, then go on for an hour
          and forty five minutes about this year’s E3. We’ll catch up on letters
          next week.
        </p>
        <p>This week’s music, in order of appearance:</p>
        <p>How To Destroy Angels – A Drowning (Treading Water Mix);</p>
        <p>The Mars Volta – Televators</p>
        <p>

        <h3><strong>No Rebel FM this week - 06/10/10</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Sorry guys. As Anthony is working on three previews right this second
          that have to be done in 12 hours and I have a whiteboard next to me
          with approximately 32 previews to be written in the next 7 days, there
          will not be a Rebel FM this week. I apologize for the late notice; we
          were trying to make this happen, but this time things just fell
          through for us. I’ll try to wrangle up a show next week though,
          hopefully with some fun guests.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Rebel FM Episode 64 – 06/04/10</strong></h3>
        <p>
          We triumph over old technical issues this week in a show that went off
          without a hitch of computer or canine origin. We talk about Bad
          Company 2 co-op, Transformers, Splinter Cell DLC, Snoopy Flying Ace
          and more. Then we move on to your surprises and disappointments of
          2010 so far and close out with some letters.
