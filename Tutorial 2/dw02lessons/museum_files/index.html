    <p>Exhibit 3</p>
    <p>Around the Solar System and Back</p>
    <p>
      Ever wonder how those new NASA engines will propel a vehicle out in space?
      It's not like opening a steam valve like on the Trains of the Wild West
      exhibit. Step in side our engineering control center of a virtual space
      craft as it flies through the solar system collecting samples, chasing
      comets, and orbiting planets. None of this could happen without you at the
      engine controls routing power to achieve these goals. Bring back some good
      samples to be analyzed!
