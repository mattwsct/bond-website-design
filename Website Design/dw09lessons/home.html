        <p>
          There's big news at OrganicUtopia this month! We've expanded to
          include 2 new lines of body and earth-friendly products. We now carry
          bio-degradeable furniture - imagine a couch you can leave on the
          street that will slowly decompose back into Mother Earth! We also have
          added recyclable shopping bags, which eliminate the need for the
          age-old question &quot;paper or plastic?&quot;. These bags are tough,
          stylish, and eco-friendly!
        </p>
        <h1>what do we do?</h1>
        <p>
          We've got everything from healthy<a href="#"> lifestyle foods</a> and
