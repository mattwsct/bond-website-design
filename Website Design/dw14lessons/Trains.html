        >If you lived in Boston and had to get to San Fransisco, a very long
        ocean voyage was in your future. But, with the advent of the steam
        locomotive, you could now make that journey in a fraction of the time.
        Imagine seeing the entire country coast-to-coast for the first time!
        America is a vast land with diverse landscapes to ponder about. And just
        as diverse were the trains that pulled you across the plains, up the
        mountains, and over the rivers. Put on the engineer hat and operate a
        simulated train as you shovel plastic rocks to make OlÕ Smokey go faster
        up hills and hit the breaks as you head down hill to deliver the
        passengers at their station. YouÕll learn that thereÕs more to operating
        a steam engine than go fast and slow down!</font
