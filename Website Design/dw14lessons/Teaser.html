        If you lived in Boston and had to get to San Fransisco, a very long
        ocean voyage was in your future. But, with the advent of the steam
        locomotive, you could now make that journey in a fraction of the time.
        Imagine seeing the entire country coast-to-coast for the first time!...

        Ever wonder how those new NASA engines will propel a vehicle out in
        space? ItÕs not like opening a steam valve like on the Trains of the
        Wild West exhibit...</font

        Spiders crawl up walls. Flies sit on walls. Geckos climb up walls. What
        makes these creatures able to scale shear surfaces without falling off?
        WeÕve come a long way since Velcro...

        With so much of the planet covered in water, we take itÕs presence for
        granted. It falls from the sky as rain, floats down as snow, makes the
        summers hot and humid, and cools us off as icy cold drinks. But why does
        this incredible substance do so much?...
