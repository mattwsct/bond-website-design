        >Sure we can show you all the formula data you could ever want to read
        about how a golf ball stays aloft in the air. But does that mean
        anything to you? Why donÕt you try teeing off a golf ball at our
        Aerodynamics in Sport exhibit. You can see the ball leave the tee and
        have a computer projected flight path illustrate the dynamics of force,
        impact, velocity, acceleration and friction.<br />
        But, itÕs not just indents in round shapes that make things fly. Raised
        surfaces like seams on a baseball can change predictable flight paths.
        YouÕll learn about the subtle mix of art and science behind how throw a
        knuckleball that will float and dance on the way to the plate.
        Curveballs, sinkers, split fingers will all be explained. The best part
        is you get to throw these pitches with specially marked baseballs that
        tell you where to put your fingers on the ball. You can even see on our
        pitching machines how the big leaguers throw those pitches at up to 100
        miles an hour!
