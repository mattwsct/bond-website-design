        Spiders crawl up walls. Flies sit on walls. Geckos climb up walls. What
        makes these creatures able to scale shear surfaces without falling off?
        WeÕve come a long way since Velcro. YouÕll take an up close look at the
        hand and feet of these creatures and see itÕs not slime, ooze or goo
        keeping them from falling off. ItÕs just plain old hair. Feel up for a
        bigger challenge? Put on the Gecko Suit and crawl around on our sixty
        degree wall. See if you can reach the top! The Fly on the Wall room will
        have you launching into the air on a rope swing trying to stick to the
        wall on the other side. Just remember to let go of the rope!<br />
        But itÕs not just critters that can stick to things. Chemical
        engineering has created hundreds of substances that when you apply it
        between two items, theyÕre never coming apart! YouÕll take a look at
        history of bonding agents starting with basic mortar all the way through
        modern complex epoxies. You can even mix up your own batch of SuperStick
        in our virtual chemistry lab. YouÕll mix up the glue and then stick a 5
        pound, 50 pound, 200 pound or 1000 pound box to the ceiling. See who can
        create strongest batch of SuperStick and keep it up there the
        longest!</font
