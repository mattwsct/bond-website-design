        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>What is BUSA?</h3>
        <p>
          The Bond University Student Association (or BUSA) is a student
          organisation comprised of elected Bond students. We exist to ensure
          that every Bond student has the ability to get involved in life on
          campus, through clubs and societies, social and sporting events and
          external activities. We also provide academic and support services to
          Bond students who need advice or extra assistance in settling in to
          university life.
        </p>
        <h3>What is SAM?</h3>
        <p>
          The Student Activity Membership (or SAM) is available for all students
          to purchase for only $110 per semester. It is an essential part of
          getting involved in university life on and off campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          It includes some great benefits including at least 1/3 of the price of
          all BUSA-run activities and social events such as Pub Crawl, Student's
          Ball and Race Day. It also gives you free access to BUSA's weekly
          &lsquo;Wednesday by the Water' BBQ and Don's Tavern each Thursday
          night. In addition, it entitles you to unlimited use of all of Bond's
          sporting facilities and group gym classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be purchased at the Information Hub during Bond Week, or
          anytime throughout the semester at the Bond University Institute for
          Sport.
        </p>

          BUSA-affiliated clubs and societies.
